                        <h2>2022 Chess Calendar</h2>
                            <h3>Colin McGourty</h3>
                                <p>The 2022 Chess Calendar begins with Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana topping the field for 
                                    the Tata Steel Masters from January 15th onwards, and, if all goes to plan, it’s a year that’s 
                                    going to feature another Candidates Tournament and the first over-the-board World Chess Olympiad 
                                    since 2018. Whatever happens with the pandemic, the Meltwater Champions Chess Tour will be back, 
                                    with nine high stakes events running from February 19th to November 20th. </p>
                                <p>Below we’ve gathered together all the info about the major chess events already scheduled for 2022, 
                                    though we’ll be updating it during the year as more events are announced or plans change. Let us 
                                    know in the comments below if there’s something we’re missing! </p>
                                    <br>
                        <h4>Current and future events:</h4>
                            <br>
                        <h4>March 1 - 14 | FIDE Grand Prix 2 | Belgrade, Serbia </h4>
                            <img src="images/ChessCalendar_2.jpg">
                                <p>The 2nd of three events in the 24-player Grand Prix series that determines the final two places in 
                                    the 2022 Candidates Tournament. The players start in pools of four players who play each other twice, 
                                    with the winners of each pool going forwards to the semi-finals.</p>
                                    <br>
                        <h4>March 2 - 12 | Howell vs. Grandelius match | London, UK </h4>
                            <img src="images/ChessCalendar_3.jpg">
                                <p>England's David Howell will take on Swedish no. 1 Nils Grandelius in a 10-game classical match to mark the 
                                30th anniversary of the founding of the London Chess Centre.</p>
                                    <br>
                        <h4>March 3 - June 19 | Chess Bundesliga | Germany </h4>
                            <p>This German Chess League is the strongest season-long team event in chess, featuring 16 teams who play 
                                each other over 15 rounds spread over a number of weekends in venues across Germany. The planned January 
                                start for this year’s event was put back to March over Coronavirus concerns.  </p>
                                <br>
                        <h4>March 19 - 26 | Meltwater Champions Chess Tour 2 | chess24 </h4>
                            <p>The Meltwater Champions Chess Tour is back with Magnus Carlsen looking to defend the title he won in the 
                                inaugural $1.6 million tour. This is the second of six Regular events on the 2022 Tour, which will also 
                                feature three Majors. More details soon.</p>
                                <br>
                        <h4>March 21 - April 4 | FIDE Grand Prix 3 | Berlin, Germany </h4>
                            <p>The 3rd and final event of the 24-player Grand Prix series, that determines the final two places in the 2022 Candidates Tournament. </p>
                                <br>
                        <h4>March 27 - April 6 | European Individual Chess Championship | Terme Catez, Slovenia</h4>
                            <p>The European Chess Championship is a prestigious title to win, but for many players the event functions 
                                mainly as a qualifier for the FIDE World Cup. There are 20 places in that event up for grabs. </p>
                                <br>
                        <h4>April 6 - 12 | Reykjavik Open | Reykjavik, Iceland </h4>
                            <img src="images/ChessCalendar_4.jpg"><span>The Reykjavik Open returns to its traditional Harpa venue | photo: chess24</span>
                                <p>The Reykjavik Open had to be cancelled in 2020, while in 2021 it functioned as the European Championship. In 2022 it’s returning 
                                to its old format as an Open tournament and also plans to return to its traditional venue, the Harpa Music and Conference Centre. </p>
                                    <br>
                        <h4>April 20 - 28 | Meltwater Champions Chess Tour 3: 1st Major | chess24 </h4>
                            <p>The Meltwater Champions Chess Tour is back with Magnus Carlsen looking to defend the title he won in the inaugural $1.6 million tour. 
                                This is the first Major on the 2022 Tour, which also features six Regular events and two more Majors. More details soon. </p>
                                <br>
                        <h4>April 20 - 29 | The American Cup | Saint Louis, USA </h4>
                            <p>A new event featuring two 8-player knockout tournaments, with the twist that players are only knocked out if they lose two matches. 
                                If they lose one they drop down to an elimination bracket but still have a chance to win the tournament. </p>
                                <br>
                        <h4>April 27 - May 8 | Mitropa Chess Club Cup | Corte, Corsica, France</h4>
                            <p>The Mitropa Chess Club Cup is an annual team tournament organised by ten chess federations in Central Europe. </p>
                                <br>
                        <h4>April 30 - May 4 | World Youth Rapid and Blitz Championship | Greece</h4>
                            <p>The World Youth Rapid and Blitz Championship will be held in Under 8, U10, U12, U14, U16 and U18 age categories. </p>
                                <br>
                        <h4>May 1 - 10 | Russian Team Championships | Sochi, Russia </h4>
                            <p>The Russian Team Championships in Sochi are traditionally one of the world’s strongest team events, though in 2021 it was notable that 
                                the top tournament featured no players at all from outside Russia. That’s likely to change in 2022, if the pandemic allows. </p>
                                <br>
                        <h4>May 4 - 14 | Superbet Chess Classic Romania | Bucharest, Romania </h4>

                                <p>The first event on the 5-event $1.4 million Grand Chess Tour is a 10-player classical round-robin with a $350,000 prize fund. </p>
                                    <br>
                        <h4>May 5 - 16 | World Senior Team Championship | Acqui Terme, Italy</h4>
                            <p>The World Senior Team Championship for teams in 50+ and 65+ age categories was postponed from 2021 to 2022 due to the pandemic. </p>
                                <br>
                        <h4>May 18 - 23 | Superbet Rapid & Blitz Poland | Warsaw, Poland </h4>
                            <p>The second tournament of the 5-event $1.4 million Grand Chess Tour is a 10-player event featuring three days of rapid chess (25+10) followed by two days of 
                                blitz (3+2), with a $175,000 prize fund. </p>
                                <br>
                        <h4>May 19 - 26 | Meltwater Champions Chess Tour 4 | chess24 </h4>
                            <p>The Meltwater Champions Chess Tour is back with Magnus Carlsen looking to defend the title he won in the inaugural $1.6 million tour. This is the third of six 
                                Regular events on the 2022 Tour, which will also feature three Majors. More details soon. </p>
                                <br>
                        <h4>May 30 - June 11 | Norway Chess | Stavanger, Norway </h4>

                                <p>Norway Chess is one of the few major international chess events to continue during the pandemic, though with a reduced 6-player field in 
                                    both 2020 and 2021. If Magnus Carlsen plays he’ll be bidding for a 5th Norway Chess title, and a 4th in a row. </p>
                                    <br>
                        <h4>June 7 - 17 | Prague International Chess Festival | Prague, Czech Republic </h4>
                            <img src="images/ChessCalendar_7.jpg">
                                <p>This will be the 4th edition of the Prague Chess Festival, one of the brightest recent additions to the chess calendar. As well as the Masters, won in 2020 by 
                                    Alireza Firouzja and in 2021 by Sam Shankland, there’s likely to be a Challengers, Futures and also an Open.  </p>
                                    <br>
                        <h4>June 16 - July 7 | Candidates Tournament | Madrid, Spain </h4>

                                <p>The Candidates Tournament is an 8-player, 14-round event that will decide who earns the right to face Magnus Carlsen in the 2023 World Chess Championship match. 
                                    A welcome change this year is that a tie for 1st place will be decided by a playoff and not by mathematical tiebreakers, though it’s worth noting that if Magnus 
                                    decides not to play the match, then a tie for 2nd place would matter more, since the top two will go on to play the match. </p>
                                <p>The tournament will feature Ian Nepomniachtchi (2021 runner-up), Jan-Krzysztof Duda (World Cup winner), Sergey Karjakin (World Cup runner-up), Alireza Firouzja 
                                    (Grand Swiss winner), Fabiano Caruana (Grand Swiss runner-up), Teimour Radjabov (wildcard after turning down his chance to play in 2020) and two players from the FIDE Grand Prix. </p>
                                    <br>
                        <h4>June 25 - July 6 | Russian Championship Higher League | Bryansk, Russia </h4>
                            <p>The top five Open and Women’s players from this formidable open qualify for the Russian Chess Championship Superfinals later in the year. </p>
                                <br>
                        <h4>July 10 - 17 | Meltwater Champions Chess Tour 5 | chess24 </h4>
                            <p>The Meltwater Champions Chess Tour is back with Magnus Carlsen looking to defend the title he won in the inaugural $1.6 million tour. This is the fourth of six Regular 
                                events on the 2022 Tour, which will also feature three Majors. More details soon. </p>
