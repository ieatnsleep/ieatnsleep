                        <h2>Chennai wins right to host 2022 Chess Olympiad</h2>

                        <h3>Colin McGourty</h3>

                        <p>Chennai, India will host the 44th Chess Olympiad in late July and early August 
                            2022 after the government of Tamil Nadu guaranteed $10 million in funding to 
                            host the massive team chess event, that in 2018 featured nearly 1,700 participants. 
                            The 2022 Olympiad was originally granted to Belarus, then moved to Russia, 
                            and now in the wake of Russia’s war on Ukraine has been moved to India. 15th 
                            World Chess Champion Vishy Anand, a resident of Chennai, has been an enthusiastic 
                            supporter of the bid.</p>

                        <img src="images/Chennai_1.jpeg" alt=""><span>There's nothing quite like a 
                            Chess Olympiad! | photo: Alina l'Ami, 2018 Batumi Olympiad</span>
                        
                        <p>The 43rd Chess Olympiad was held in Batumi, Georgia in 2018, with China winning 
                            both the Open and Women’s event. The tournament had been held every two years since 
                            1972, but in 2020, when the event was planned for Russia, the pandemic intervened, 
                            with the massive participation event logistically impossible. An Online Olympiad was 
                            held instead, with the most unlikely of endings when Russia and India were declared 
                            joint gold medalists after internet issues hit the final.  </p>
                        
                        <p>Nevertheless, the gold medals for the rising chess powerhouse of India were widely 
                            celebrated, including by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
                        
                        <p>The World Chess Federation FIDE was tempted by the success of that event to hold a 
                            2nd Online Olympiad in 2021, where Russia this time finished clear first, ahead of 
                            the USA (silver) and India (bronze), but the experience wasn’t comparable to the 
                            chess celebration of hundreds of countries from all over the world meeting up in 
                            one venue. </p>
                        
                        <img src="images/chennai_2.jpeg" alt=""><span>India and Russia's controversial joint 
                            gold is not likely to be repeated anytime soon! | image: FIDE</span>
                        
                        <p>As the pandemic has begun to recede, however, there has been more turmoil. In October 
                            2018 it was announced that Minsk, Belarus would host the 2022 Olympiad, but in 2020 
                            Belarus were stripped of the Olympiad. FIDE talked about financial obligations not 
                            being met, but holding the Olympiad in Belarus looked inconceivable in the wake of 
                            mass protests against the alleged falsification of the 2020 presidential elections.</p>
                        
                        <p>The 2022 Olympiad was instead given to Russia (the planned hosts for 2020), whose 
                            President Vladimir Putin had been instrumental in shoring up Alexander Lukashenko’s 
                            government in Belarus. Originally planned for Khanty-Mansiysk, the event was moved 
                            to Moscow, but then, last month, Russia invaded Ukraine, partly from Belarusian 
                            territory, and holding the Olympiad in Russia became unthinkable overnight. FIDE 
                            soon announced that Russia had been stripped of the right to host the Olympiad.</p>
                        
                        <p>That left FIDE needing to find a last-minute host for the most difficult and expensive 
                            of all chess events, but fortunately this is where India stepped up. A huge chess 
                            boom has seen India go from having just Vishy Anand as a grandmaster to having 73 
                            grandmasters in the space of a few decades, with India already ranked 4th among chess 
                            federations (behind Russia, USA and China) before its army of young stars has yet 
                            reached their true potential.</p>

                        <p>The growing popularity of the game of chess in what most historians consider the country 
                            that created it has created great potential for sponsorship. In 2013, the then Chief 
                            Minister of Tamil Nadu J Jayalithaa provided the backing for the Anand-Carlsen World 
                            Chess Championship match to be played in Chennai, and in 2022 her successor, M.K. 
                            Stalin, announced that Chennai would host the Olympiad.</p>
                        
                        <p>He later called the event “a milestone in the history of Tamil Nadu”. </p>

                        <p>15th World Chess Champion Vishy Anand had supported the bid. </p>

                        <p>“Vanakam” is “hello”, or “welcome” in Tamil.  </p>

                        <p>The amount of money required to host an event such as the Olympiad was made clear by the 
                            Tamil Nadu Government guaranteeing $10 million in funds to cover expenses. </p>

                        <p>The Olympiad will take place in the convention centre at the Four Points by Sheraton hotel, 
                            located in the south of Chennai, with the exact dates still to be confirmed. </p>

                        <p>The holding of the Chess Olympiad in India has been greeted with delight by the Indian chess community.</p>

                        <p>Chess players from all over the world will also be excited at the chance to visit India, though 
                            there are still shadows on the horizon. The pandemic isn’t over, and massive lockdowns, for 
                            instance in China, could still interfere with the tournament — as noted, the Chinese teams 
                            are the reigning champions in both the Open and Women’s sections. </p>

                        <p>The other major issue is the war in Ukraine. It looks inconceivable that the Russian teams would 
                            be allowed to play, even if the war did end in the near future, with Belarus likely to come under 
                            the same sanctions. Will Ukraine be able to field teams? Will war or uncertainty spread? At the 
                            moment India finds itself in the near impossible position of trying to maintain good relations 
                            with both Russia and the USA/Europe.  </p>

                        <img src="images/chennai_3.jpg" alt=""><span>Chennai, India will be holding its 2nd massive chess event after 
                            the 2013 Anand-Carlsen World Championship match</span>

                        <p>And then there’s the question of FIDE Elections, which traditionally are held alongside the 
                            Olympiad every four years. Former Russian Deputy President Arkady Dvorkovich was elected 
                            in 2018 in Batumi. His Russian ties had ensured healthy funding for FIDE projects, but the 
                            war has seen him face demands to resign, not least from Ukrainian chess players.</p>

                        <p>In a US interview Dvorkovich seemed to take personal risks by condemning the war and supporting 
                            restrictions on Russian players. That saw him called a “son of a bitch” by Dmitry Rogozin, 
                            another former Deputy Prime Minister of Russia and the head of the Russian space program. 
                            Rogozin has been one of the most vocal supporters of Vladimir Putin in his latest war.</p>

                        <p>Whether because of that, or simply since he was addressing a different audience, Arkady Dvorkovich 
                            made a shocking statement as Head of the Skolkovo Science Park outside of Moscow. He criticised 
                            sanctions and companies leaving Russia and adopted the language of state propaganda when he 
                            “clarified” what he meant by being against war.</p>

                        <p>Removing Nazis and bringing peace were among Putin's absurd justifications for unleashing massive 
                            destruction on a normal, democratic country. If the FIDE President was quoted accurately it must 
                            be in great doubt whether he can continue in his role until the next presidential elections during 
                            the Olympiad. If he did, we might also get boycotts of the Olympiad. </p>

                        <p>Nevertheless, we have to hope that the 2022 Olympiad will be what Olympiads traditionally are — a 
                            celebration of the diversity and sense of community of the chess world. Chennai has the potential 
                            to be a wonderful venue. </p>
