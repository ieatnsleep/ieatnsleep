                        <h2>Ivanchuk echoes call for Russian players to be banned</h2>

                        <h3>Leon Watson</h3>
                        <p>Chess great Vasyl Ivanchuk has made his position clear on the war in Ukraine 
                            by echoing demands for a blanket ban on all Russian players and the resignation of 
                            FIDE President Arkady Dvorkovich. </p>
                        <p>The 52-year-old Ukrainian, nicknamed Chucky, put his name to a joint letter featuring his 
                            country's top grandmasters that repeated a series of calls for a more hardline approach. </p>
                        <p>Until now, Ivanchuk had not publicly indicated his thoughts on the invasion of his country. </p>
                        <p>But the Ukrainian Chess Federation has been desperate to apply maximum pressure on both the European 
                            Chess Federation and FIDE, so enlisted one of the country's greatest ever players to speak out. </p>
                        <p>Ivanchuk, a former world number 2 and World Champion in blitz and rapid chess, joins former FIDE World 
                            Chess Champion Ruslan Ponomariov, two-time Ukrainian champion Andrey Volokitin and Ukraine's current 
                            number 1 Anton Korobov in calling for the ban. </p>
                        <p>The other signatories are GMs Kirill Shevchenko, Volodymyr Onyshchuk, Yuriy Kuzubov, Yuriy Kryvoruchko, 
                            Martyn Kravtsiv, Alexandr Moiseenko, Zahar Efimenko, Volodymyr Baklan, Bernadskiy Vitaliy, Andriy Vovk, 
                            Yuri Vovk, Oleksandr Sulypa, Nazar Firman, Mykhaylo Oleksiyenko, Andrey Baryshpolets, Volodymyr Vetoshko, 
                            Oleksandr Kovchan, Vadim Malakhatko, Yaroslav Zherebukh, Alexander Areshchenko, Pavlo Vorontsov, Evgeny Shtembuliak, 
                            IMs Sergiy Pavlov, Natalia Zhukova, Volodymyr Grabinsky, and WIM Irina Andrenko. The UCF says there are "many others". </p>
                        <p>Players in Ukraine have also done more than write letters of protest â€” with several posting pictures online of them taking up 
                            arms to defend their country. </p>
                        <img src="images/Sulypa_1.jpg" alt=""><span>Chess Grandmaster and Captain of the Ukrainian Team Oleksandr Sulypa posted this photo with the caption, 
                            "I am defending my land from enemies and "peacekeepers". The truth will win!"</span>
                        <p>Russia's top chess players also broke rank in an open letter appealing directly to Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the war. </p>
                        <p>Ivanchuk's intervention comes after a fraught two weeks for FIDE, the governing body of chess, since Russia's invasion of Ukraine supported by Belarus.</p>
                        <p>FIDE initially responded quickly to the anger surrounding the act of war by stripping Moscow of the 2022 Chess Olympiad, which was due to start in July. </p>
                        <p>As pressure increased to go further, the FIDE Council then banned all officially-sanctioned events from taking place in Russia and Belarus and stopped players 
                            from both countries competing under their country's flag. </p>
                        <p>Ties were cut with certain Russian corporate sponsors and donors and FIDE cited the Russian Grandmaster Sergey Karjakin for an alleged breach of its Code of 
                            Ethics after the 32-year-old made a series of posts supporting the invasion on social media. One of the punishments Karjakin could face is losing his place in 
                            the upcoming Candidates Tournament. </p>
                        <p>Since then the minutes of a meeting on March 1 also revealed that FIDE has stripped the 12th World Champion, and one of the best players of all time, Anatoly 
                            Karpov of his Ambassador for Life honour.</p>
                        <img src="images/Karpov_1.jpg" alt=""><span>Anatoly Karpov appeared in Wijk aan Zee in 2017 | photo: Tarjei J. Svensen</span>
                        <p>The 70-year-old 12th World Champion, now a member of Russia's Duma parliament, voted in favour of measures that paved the way for war, an act that saw him added 
                            to the EU sanctions list. Karpov loses the title temporarily until the matter is discussed in full at the next FIDE General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, FIDE has made it easier for Russian and Belarusian players to switch federation if they do not want to play under the Russian flag. </p>
                        <p>The measure led to the Grandmaster and prolific trainer Evgeny Romanov becoming the first top player to change federations as he moved to Norway. More titled players are expected to follow.</p>
                        <p>However, FIDE's response has not shielded it from accusations of being soft on Vladimir Putin's regime. </p>
                        <p>Critics have noted that FIDE stopped short of an outright ban on Russian and Belarusian players, which most sporting organisations have now implemented following 
                            guidance from the International Olympic Committee. Instead, FIDE is allowing Russians and Belarusians to compete under a FIDE or neutral flag outside their country. </p>
                        <p>FIDE also did not discuss the position of its Russian President Arkady Dvorkovich and took no action against the Russian Chess Federation, which has several 
                            individuals on its Honorary Board of Trustees who have been sanctioned by Western governments and the European Union. </p>
                        <p>As FIDE held back, the Nordic Chess Federation, the Dutch Chess Federation and the English Chess Federation have gone the extra step and banned all Russian and Belarusian participation.</p>
                        <p>A key demand of the Ukrainian Chess Federation is the resignation of Dvorkovich, who has served as FIDE President since 2018. If not, the UCF demanded an extraordinary General Assembly to decide Dvorkovich's future. </p>
                        <p>The letter states that Dvorkovich, a former Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, should resign because as a former aide to Putin he is "personally responsible for the formation of Russia's aggressive foreign policy".</p>
                        <p>However, FIDE has not responded to any calls for Dvorkovich to resign and has not been forthcoming on calls for a snap General Assembly. </p>
